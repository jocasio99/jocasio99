## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh and I am a Cyber Security student who wants to do lots of cool stuff and share my journey. I am a bit of a jack of all trades, programming, pc repair/building, and networking.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first game using Godot and GDScript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Godot, GDScript, and Python on my own. For school, I am currently studying for the CompTIA Network+.
- ðŸš€ I plan on creating a keylogger, a SIEM, a password strength checker, a Caesar cipher, and more!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Python is my favorite right now, even though I have previously done some work with HTML, CSS, Java, C++, and Snap!
